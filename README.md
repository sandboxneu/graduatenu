# ScheduleNEU

An automatic schedule builder utilizing your current degree audit information.

Dependencies:
- Node.js

To run:

- Download your degree audit from the Northeastern MyPAWS degree audit system. Do this by clicking the 'printer-friendly' mode, then right-clicking the page and/or using a command line tool of your choice to obtain the degree audit file. Ensure that the file name is 'Degree\ Audit.html' and that it is located in this repository's file system.
- Execute the command ``` node parse_audit.js ```
- Execute ``` node parser.js ```

After this, an organized JSON file with information regarding your current degree trajectory should be present in the produced schedule.json file.

In the future, this functionality will comprise a portion of the backend of a web application designed to facilitate the simple creation of schedules via a degree audit and/or supplemental information provided by the end user.
