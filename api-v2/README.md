# GraduateNU API V2

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the app

1. Run `yarn dev:db:up` from the project root to run the database in docker. You can run `yarn dev:db:down` from the project root to take down the database when you're done.

2. Run `yarn dev` from within the api-v2 directory to run the server in watch mode.

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn test

# e2e tests
$ yarn test:e2e

# test coverage
$ yarn test:cov
```

## Design Decisions

A running log of design decisions that were taken. These can and will probably change as the server scales.

- If you want to change the way things work, start a discussion, make the change and document it here!

- If you're making changes to the codebase, please ensure that your changes follow the design documented here!

### Error Handling

- Services will be HTTP agnostic and not throw HTTP errors.

- Services will not throw errors in general, and will return `null` for exceptional behavior. For instance, if a user with the same email already exists, return `null` and expect the controller to handle this. This isn't great since we loose the error that actually happened and so we probably want to implement more specific error handling than just returning `null` at the service level.

- Controllers will handle the case when services return `null` and throw appropriate HTTP errors.
