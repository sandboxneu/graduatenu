# GraduateNU Frontend V2

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run the full stack application with `yarn dev:v2` from the root of the monorepo.

To run only the frontend, use `yarn dev` from the root of this workspace(`packages/frontend-v2`).

You can start editing the pages by modifying files in `pages/`. The pages auto-update as you edit the file.
