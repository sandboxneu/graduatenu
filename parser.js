JSON Schedule Formatter for ScheduleNEU

  /*
  POTENTIAL CRITERIAS for building schedule:

  coop cycle (spring/fall/none?)
  option for other requirements/objectives (minors)
  when classes are available
  prerequisits for classes

  ADD-ONS:

  "difficulty" of classes (to balance workload)
  suggest classes that overlap with requirements (NUPATH, major, etc.)


  INFORMATION NEEDED: (whether scraped, or from SearchNEU)

  when classes are available
  prerequisites for classes
  "difficulty" of classes - from trace? or by survey
